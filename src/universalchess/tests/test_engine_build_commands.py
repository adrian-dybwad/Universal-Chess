"""Regression tests for engine source-build command definitions.

These pin platform-specific build flags in the ``ENGINES`` catalog that cannot
be exercised in CI (they only fail when compiling on the target board), so the
build-command string itself is the highest deterministic level at which the
regression can be guarded.

        Why this test exists: a field board (armhf) failed to install Rodent IV
        because its Makefile omits ``-latomic``. Rodent IV uses 64-bit
        ``std::atomic``; on 32-bit ARM those lower to libatomic calls
        (``__atomic_store_8`` etc.), so the link aborts with "undefined reference
        to __atomic_store_8" and the engine never builds.

        How the regression manifests: if someone reverts to the bare
        ``make ... EXENAME=../rodentIV`` command, ``-latomic`` disappears from the
        script below and this assertion fails -- mirroring the on-device link
        failure that cannot be reproduced in CI.

        Why this test exists: the Makefile recipe places ``$(LDFLAGS)`` before the
        source objects, and the toolchain links ``--as-needed`` by default, which
        silently drops a ``-latomic`` that appears before any reference to it. Only
        ``-Wl,--no-as-needed`` keeps it linked in that position.

        How the regression manifests: dropping ``--no-as-needed`` would let the
        link succeed nowhere on 32-bit ARM despite ``-latomic`` being present, so
        this guards that the flag pairing stays intact.

        Why this test exists: 64-bit targets inline these atomics and need no
        libatomic; forcing ``--no-as-needed -latomic`` unconditionally would add an
        unused runtime dependency there. The fix gates the flags on ``uname -m``.

        How the regression manifests: if the arch guard is removed, the flags would
        apply on every architecture; this checks the ``uname -m`` ARM case remains.
