## [2.0.0] - Unreleased

### Overview

Universal Chess 2.0 is a major rewrite of the DGTCentaurMods project, focusing on
code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. The codebase has been completely
reorganized with proper module structure, comprehensive tests, and modern CI/CD.

### Added

- **Three-color (red/white/black) e-paper mode**: Opt-in `[display] three_color`
  switch for tri-color BWR panels, implemented in both the UC8151D (V2) and
  SSD1680 (V1) drivers (tri-color is a property of the panel, not the controller)
  - Fixes the black-into-red bleed by routing the B/W plane to the controller's
    B/W RAM and a parallel red plane to its red RAM (UC8151D `0x10`/`0x13`,
    SSD1680 `0x24`/`0x26`); the mono partial path had written B/W into the red RAM
  - Hybrid refresh: fast black/white updates during normal play; the slow full
    tri-color refresh (~12–15 s) only when red appears, changes, or clears
  - Highlights the checked king and checker, a threatened queen and its attacker,
    the game result line, and losing-side evaluation-graph bars in red
  - Live toggle in the Display tuning settings card and a red web-mirror preview
    (no reboot required)

- **Engine Registry**: Centralized management of UCI chess engine instances
  - Prevents duplicate engine processes
  - Automatic lifecycle management
  - Shared engine access across features

- **Engine Install Queue**: Background installation system for chess engines
  - Queue multiple engines for installation
  - Progress tracking with UI feedback
  - Cancel/clear queue operations
  - Install history

- **Update Checker**: Pull-based update system
  - Checks GitHub releases for new versions
  - Supports stable and nightly channels
  - Download and install from the device

- **Maia Engine Support**: Human-like neural network chess engine
  - Specialized ARM build script with memory management
  - Downloads all 9 ELO-rated weight files (1100-1900)
  - Single-threaded compilation for Raspberry Pi

- **Modern CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automated testing on Python 3.9, 3.11, 3.13
  - Automated package builds on release tags
  - Nightly builds from main branch
  - Automatic release creation

- **Version Management**
  - VERSION file created during package build
  - `scripts/bump-version.sh` for semantic versioning
  - Proper version comparison for updates

### Changed

- **Project Structure**: Complete reorganization
  - Source code moved to `src/universalchess/`
  - Build scripts moved to `scripts/`
  - Packaging files in `packaging/`
  - Development tools in `tools/`

- **Package Architecture**: Changed to `all` (architecture-independent)
  - Python code works on both armhf and arm64
  - Engine binaries handled separately

- **Entry Point**: Renamed from `universal.py` to `main.py`

- **Board Controller**: Explicit initialization instead of import-time
  - Better test isolation
  - Cleaner startup sequence

### Removed

- **Deprecated Engines**: Fire, Laser (x86-only, incompatible with ARM)
- **Legacy CI**: Docker-based cron CI system (moved to `.github/legacy-ci/`)
- **Obsolete Tests**: Removed outdated promotion hardware tests

### Fixed

- Changing a player's engine (or other player-defining setting) from the web did
  not take effect in the next game: a board-reset new game restarts play in place
  and reused the player objects built when the game first started, so the old
  engine kept playing. The running game's player configuration is now captured as
  a signature; when it differs from the current settings, the next new game (board
  reset or menu PLAY) rebuilds the players so the new engine is loaded.
- Web UI engine install never started and the progress notice spun forever: the
  React Settings page posted to `/api/engines/{install,uninstall}/<name>` with no
  body, but the backend expects `POST /api/engines/{install,uninstall}` with the
  engine name in the JSON body, so every request 404'd. The page now uses the
  correct contract, polls `/api/engines/status`, surfaces failures, shows
  `Installing <name>...` on the button with the "may take several minutes" notice
  beside it, and restores the in-progress state after a page reload
- Engine timeout issues on Raspberry Pi (removed default timeouts)
- Multiple engine instance conflicts (via EngineRegistry)
- dpkg lock conflicts during installation
- Various build script path issues

### Security

- No security issues addressed in this release

### Notes

- Minimum Python version: 3.9 (Debian Bullseye)
- Maximum tested Python version: 3.13 (Debian Trixie)
- Requires Raspberry Pi with DGT Centaur board
