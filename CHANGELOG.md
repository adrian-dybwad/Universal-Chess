## [2.0.0] - Unreleased

### Overview

Universal Chess 2.0 is a major rewrite of the DGTCentaurMods project, focusing on
code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. The codebase has been completely
reorganized with proper module structure, comprehensive tests, and modern CI/CD.

### Added

- **Stoppable, resumable engine installs**: A source build can run for an hour,
  and until now the only way out was to let it finish or reboot the board, which
  threw the work away. An install can now be stopped and picked up later.
  - Stop from the Settings page, or from the options menu the board's progress
    screen opens with TICK. The build stops at the next command boundary; its
    process group is terminated so no compiler is left running.
  - BACK on the board's progress screen leaves the install running rather than
    stopping it, so the board can be used for something else while an engine
    builds. A status-bar indicator shows the build is still going, and the
    engine's own screen offers the way back to it.
  - Stopping keeps the build tree, so resuming continues from the objects already
    compiled instead of starting the build over. A resume point records the git
    ref that was building, and the tree is only reused when the ref still
    matches, so resuming cannot silently produce a binary from a different
    version.
  - Several engines can be paused at once, and starting a different engine's
    install no longer deletes them: each resume point is a marker file inside its
    own engine's build directory rather than a single global slot. An install
    interrupted by a restart or crash is recorded the same way at startup.
  - Starting an install retires that engine's own resume point, since an engine
    that is building is not paused. A card otherwise showed "Stopped at N%" and a
    dead Resume button beside the live progress bar for the whole rebuild, and a
    fresh (non-resume) install left behind a record of a tree it had re-cloned at
    a different ref. Every other engine's paused state is untouched.
  - Discard removes a paused install's tree and resume point to free the space.
    It is destructive and cannot be undone, so it asks for confirmation on both
    the web page and the board. The board offers it at the moment an install
    stops, which is when the user knows whether they want the work back, with
    "keep" as the focused option.
  - Install, stop, resume and discard now do the same thing from either surface,
    because there is only one of each. Engine installs run in the web process
    alone -- it already owned the persisted install state, the resume points, and
    the catalog, repair and custom-engine flows -- and the board asks it to act
    over the sockets that already connect the two, then renders the shared state.
    Previously each process installed on its own manager, so a build stopped on
    the board left a tree the web could neither resume nor reclaim, and both could
    start an install at the same time. The board's own install path is gone rather
    than bridged.
  - New endpoints `POST /api/engines/{stop,resume,discard}`; resume and discard
    name their engine in the body and require authentication, as does stop. Each
    is a single function shared by the HTTP route and the board's request, so the
    rules they enforce are not implemented twice.
  - Engine management on the board requires the web service to be running. It
    says so plainly when it is not, rather than appearing to work.

- **Reckless engine**: Added the Reckless UCI engine (Rust, embedded NNUE,
  AGPL-3.0) to the installable engine catalog. It is the project's first Rust
  engine; because Debian's apt Rust (1.63) is too old for its edition-2024
  sources, both the on-device and CI builds bootstrap a pinned rustup toolchain
  and build `no-syzygy` (no clang dependency). Prebuilt binaries are produced for
  arm64 and armhf.

- **Three-color (red/white/black) e-paper mode**: Opt-in `[display] three_color`
  switch for tri-color BWR panels, implemented in both the UC8151D (V2) and
  SSD1680 (V1) drivers (tri-color is a property of the panel, not the controller)
  - Fixes the black-into-red bleed by routing the B/W plane to the controller's
    B/W RAM and a parallel red plane to its red RAM (UC8151D `0x10`/`0x13`,
    SSD1680 `0x24`/`0x26`); the mono partial path had written B/W into the red RAM
  - Hybrid refresh: fast black/white updates during normal play; the slow full
    tri-color refresh (~12–15 s) only when red appears, changes, or clears
  - Highlights the checked king and checker, a threatened queen and its attacker,
    the game result line, and losing-side evaluation-graph bars in red
  - Live toggle in the Display tuning settings card and a red web-mirror preview
    (no reboot required)

- **Engine Registry**: Centralized management of UCI chess engine instances
  - Prevents duplicate engine processes
  - Automatic lifecycle management
  - Shared engine access across features

- **Engine Install Queue**: Background installation system for chess engines
  - Queue multiple engines for installation
  - Progress tracking with UI feedback
  - Cancel/clear queue operations
  - Install history

- **Update Checker**: Pull-based update system
  - Checks GitHub releases for new versions
  - Supports stable and nightly channels
  - Download and install from the device

- **Maia Engine Support**: Human-like neural network chess engine
  - Specialized ARM build script with memory management
  - Downloads all 9 ELO-rated weight files (1100-1900)
  - Single-threaded compilation for Raspberry Pi

- **Modern CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automated testing on Python 3.9, 3.11, 3.13
  - Automated package builds on release tags
  - Nightly builds from main branch
  - Automatic release creation

- **Version Management**
  - VERSION file created during package build
  - `scripts/bump-version.sh` for semantic versioning
  - Proper version comparison for updates

### Changed

- **Project Structure**: Complete reorganization
  - Source code moved to `src/universalchess/`
  - Build scripts moved to `scripts/`
  - Packaging files in `packaging/`
  - Development tools in `tools/`

- **Package Architecture**: Changed to `all` (architecture-independent)
  - Python code works on both armhf and arm64
  - Engine binaries handled separately

- **Entry Point**: Renamed from `universal.py` to `main.py`

- **Board Controller**: Explicit initialization instead of import-time
  - Better test isolation
  - Cleaner startup sequence

### Removed

- **Deprecated Engines**: Fire, Laser (x86-only, incompatible with ARM)
- **Legacy CI**: Docker-based cron CI system (moved to `.github/legacy-ci/`)
- **Obsolete Tests**: Removed outdated promotion hardware tests

### Fixed

- Powering the Pi off killed a running engine install outright, leaving a
  part-written build tree that came back only as an "interrupted" install. A
  source build can hold the better part of an hour, and the idle timeout can fire
  in the middle of one. Shutdown and reboot now ask the install to stop first and
  wait for it to wind down, so it records a real resume point and is picked up
  where it left off. The wait watches the persisted state rather than the reply
  to the request, because an accepted stop only sets the cancel flag -- the build
  still has to reach a command boundary and write the resume point. It is bounded
  at twenty seconds and the power-off proceeds regardless: a shutdown that hangs
  on a build that will not unwind is worse than one that gives up, and startup
  reconciliation still recovers what was reached. The board asks the web, which
  owns installs, over the socket that already connects them; the web stops the
  install itself only when the board is not running to do it.
- A board that could not read its battery powered itself off after fifteen idle
  minutes, ending any engine install that was running. The idle power-off exists
  to save the battery, and the power source is known only from the baseboard's
  five-second `DGT_SEND_BATTERY_INFO` poll: when that request times out -- no
  baseboard attached, or a dead serial link -- the poll records nothing, and the
  charger flag it never wrote was a plain `False`, which reads as "on battery".
  A mains-fed Raspberry Pi with no battery at all was therefore given a
  battery-saving shutdown. The power source is now a three-way state, so a board
  that has never reported one does not power off, for the same reason
  `WIFI_ABSENT` is not `WIFI_DISABLED`: not having been told is not a reading.
  Silence *after* a reading keeps the last known source, because a board that
  reported "on battery" and then lost its link may really be on a battery and
  must still power off. The charger flag the status bar and web payload read is
  unchanged, so no indicator behaves differently.
- Changing a player's engine (or other player-defining setting) from the web did
  not take effect in the next game: a board-reset new game restarts play in place
  and reused the player objects built when the game first started, so the old
  engine kept playing. The running game's player configuration is now captured as
  a signature; when it differs from the current settings, the next new game (board
  reset or menu PLAY) rebuilds the players so the new engine is loaded.
- Web UI engine install never started and the progress notice spun forever: the
  React Settings page posted to `/api/engines/{install,uninstall}/<name>` with no
  body, but the backend expects `POST /api/engines/{install,uninstall}` with the
  engine name in the JSON body, so every request 404'd. The page now uses the
  correct contract, polls `/api/engines/status`, surfaces failures, shows
  `Installing <name>...` on the button with the "may take several minutes" notice
  beside it, and restores the in-progress state after a page reload
- Source-build progress reported far too much done and far too little time left:
  a Reckless install showed 94% and "less than a minute remaining" at its 17th
  module of ~120, with most of an hour still to run. Three causes, each fixed:
  the completed fraction divided by the units already sampled rather than by all
  of them, and since every sampled unit but the one compiling is finished, that
  ratio was near 1 from the third unit onwards; a Rust build's units were counted
  as `.rs` files when `rustc` compiles a whole crate per invocation, inflating a
  36-crate build to ~120 units and naming every crate `lib.rs`; and the compile
  rate was measured from the start of the build command, charging Reckless's
  rustup bootstrap and cargo registry fetch to every unit still to come. The
  remaining time is also withdrawn, rather than repeated, once the module in
  flight has run longer than the whole projection allows -- the case of a final
  fat-LTO crate that outlasts the 35 before it
- Engine timeout issues on Raspberry Pi (removed default timeouts)
- Multiple engine instance conflicts (via EngineRegistry)
- dpkg lock conflicts during installation
- Various build script path issues

### Security

- **The install directory is no longer writable by the service user**: everything
  under `/opt/universalchess` was owned by the account the board and web app run
  as. That included `scripts/`, whose helpers each have a passwordless sudo
  grant -- so anything able to write a file as that user could replace a helper
  and have root run it. Code, scripts and the virtualenv are now root-owned, and
  only the directories the product genuinely writes (`config`, `db`, `engines`,
  `tmp`, `web/static`, `pending-updates`) belong to the service user. The upgrade
  resets ownership, so boards that were already exposed are corrected rather than
  left as they were.
  - TLS material stays root-owned, so the certificate authority and server
    private keys can no longer be read or replaced by the web process. The
    certificate download and iOS profile still work, as those read only the
    public certificate.
  - Python bytecode is now compiled during installation. It was previously
    written on first import, which a root-owned tree no longer permits, and
    without precompilation every startup would re-parse every module.
- **Updates must be signed to install**: the updater downloads into a directory
  the service user can write, and the root helper installs whatever is there, so
  a checksum from that same directory proved nothing. Releases now carry a
  detached signature over `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and the root helper verifies it
  against a keyring shipped inside the package before the package is allowed to
  run any code. A missing keyring, manifest or signature refuses the install
  rather than skipping the check.
  - The helper also refuses a version older than the one installed, so a genuine
    but outdated release cannot be used to reintroduce a fixed issue. Deliberate
    stable/nightly switches remain possible.
  - The build refuses to produce a package without the signing keyring, since
    such a package would install and then be unable to verify any later update.
- **Downloads are verified before they are staged**: `.deb` downloads are checked
  against the release's published checksums and discarded on any mismatch,
  missing entry or unfetchable manifest. Previously the file was downloaded and
  installed as root with no integrity check at all.
- **The Lichess API token is no longer disclosed**: the settings endpoint
  returned it in clear text without authentication. It is now redacted, and
  saving settings without it leaves the stored token unchanged rather than
  erasing it.
- **Web coach endpoints no longer generate on request**: unauthenticated callers
  could trigger model calls. The statement endpoint now only returns what the
  board already produced, the tip endpoint is removed, and the model list
  requires authentication.
- **Engine option probing is cached**: an unauthenticated request could start an
  engine process per call. Results are cached per engine binary and shared
  between concurrent callers, and the cache is cleared when an engine is
  installed.
- **Removed the WebDAV path that made arbitrary files world-writable**: a request
  could set mode 0777 on any path listed in a file at the share root.
- **Password handling hardened**: WebDAV password hashes are compared in constant
  time, and the minimum password length is raised from 4 to 6.
- **Supply chain**: all GitHub Actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs rather
  than mutable tags, and a high-severity `js-yaml` advisory reached through a
  development dependency is resolved.
